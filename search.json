    "text": "Anuradha had grown up in a village where people could tell the time of day by the tilt of a coconut tree’s shadow. She knew when the breeze would turn warm, which flowers bees preferred, and which vegetables grew sulky if watered at the wrong hour.\nRavi, by contrast, had spent his childhood in a Hyderabad apartment where the only greenery was the tulsi plant his mother watered with such reverence that he never dared touch it. Gardening, to him, was something that happened in other people’s lives, like running a dairy farm or owning a pet elephant.\nWhen they bought their modest home in Padmavathi Colony, it came with a narrow strip of backyard soil and a mango tree. Anuradha saw an invitation; Ravi saw extra sweeping work after the leaves fell.\nOn their very first weekend in the new house, Anuradha declared, “We’ll start a kitchen garden.” She said it with the tone of someone reading out a wedding date — fixed and beyond discussion. Ravi nodded, coffee in hand, making a mental note to keep an eye on the water bill.\nThe backyard soon filled with ambitious seedlings: brinjal, lady’s finger, beans, green chillies, and pumpkin — this last one chosen over Ravi’s mild objection. “They’ll take over everything,” he warned. “They’ll give shade,” she countered.\nTheir styles could not have been more different. Ravi measured distances between plants with a ruler, calculated watering schedules from the weather forecast, and proudly built a drip irrigation system from spare pipes. Anuradha relied entirely on touch and instinct. “They’re thirsty today,” she would say, feeling the leaves, without so much as glancing at a chart.\nArguments were gentle, almost rehearsed. “You’re overwatering.” “You’re under-loving.”\nThe vegetables grew in their own fashion. The brinjal plant yielded exactly three fruits: one perfectly round, one lopsided, and one looking as if it had been designed by accident. The pumpkin vine spread like a conqueror, curling around bean stakes, climbing the clothesline, and once, clinging stubbornly to Ravi’s forgotten flip-flop.\nOne evening, Ravi returned from work to find Anuradha holding a small yellow pumpkin flower, her face lit up as though she had found a long-lost friend. “Look,” she said softly.\nHe took it with mock solemnity. “I think you love these plants more than you love me.” “Don’t be silly,” she replied. “I can’t make sambar out of you.”\nOver the months, the backyard became a shared language. Ravi grudgingly admitted that her guesswork often outperformed his careful calculations. Anuradha, in turn, trusted his irrigation system during the summer’s fiercest heat.\nAfter dinner, they would sit in plastic chairs under the mango tree, watching the plants sway in the night breeze. The moonlight would lay silver across the pumpkin leaves, and Anuradha would lean lightly on his shoulder. No one spoke. There was nothing to improve upon in that moment.\nNot every plant bore fruit, and not every season was kind. But tending together, through mistakes, small triumphs, and the occasional flip-flop entanglement, was its own reward.\nThat year, when they harvested their first pumpkin, Ravi carried it into the kitchen like a prize. Anuradha made pumpkin spiced appams, and they ate them hot, teasing each other over who had the bigger share.\nSomewhere outside, the pumpkin vines listened, their leaves rustling faintly, as if amused by the two humans who thought they were in charge."
