I grew up in the 90s in India, and like many of us, I found myself drawn into the gentle, ordinary-yet-magical worlds R.K. Narayan created. His stories taught me that the simplest words can hold entire universes, and that’s the spirit I carry into my own writing. What you’ll find here are glimpses from my own life: moments of trying to make sense of this journey, building a home, and leaning on the quiet strength of my family. In some ways, these stories are mine; in other ways, they’re echoes of a style and a spirit that shaped how I learned to see and tell them.
